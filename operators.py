# operators are special symbols that perform specific operations like arithmetic operations,coparision between two numbers

# arithmetic operator
a = 10
b = 20
result = a+b-a*b/a 
print(result) 

print(4**3) #4^3 cube root
print(10//3) #floor division only take integer

# comparison operator
x = 15
y = 20
z = 40
s = 40
print(x > y)
print(x <= y)
print(x == y)
print(x >= y)
print(x != y)
print(z == s)
